# Magical Creatures Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project explores the magical creatures of Numeria, focusing on their distribution across various kingdoms. It utilizes Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly` to analyze and visualize the data effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset, `magical_creatures_by_kingdom.csv`, contains the following columns:

- **Kingdom**: The name of the kingdom where the creatures reside.
- **CreatureType**: The type of mystical creature (e.g., Dragon, Unicorn).
- **Number_of_Creatures**: The total number of that creature type in the kingdom.

## Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Familiarize yourself with the dataset to understand the distribution of magical creatures across different kingdoms.
- **Visualization**: Create various visualizations to represent the data clearly and intuitively, such as:
  - Line charts
  - Pie charts
  - Histograms
  - Bar charts

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv('magical_creatures_by_kingdom.csv')
    ```

2. **Create Visualizations**: The code generates several visualizations to illustrate the data.

    - **Initial Plot**: A simple line plot to show the number of creatures per kingdom (Note: this visualization is not optimal and serves as a starting point).
    
    - **Pie Chart**: Visualize the distribution of kingdoms and the number of magical creatures within each kingdom.

    - **Histogram**: Display the number of magical creatures categorized by type in each kingdom.

    - **Bar Chart**: Illustrate the total number of creatures in each kingdom.

3. **Summarization**: The project includes functions to summarize creature distributions both by type and by kingdom, providing insights into the population of each type of creature in different kingdoms.

4. **Run the Code**: Execute the code cells in your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) to generate visualizations and summaries.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the magical ecology of Numeria, revealing patterns in creature distribution that can aid in conservation efforts and enhance the understanding of this enchanting world. Through data visualization, we can celebrate and explore the rich diversity of creatures that inhabit the kingdoms of Numeria.
